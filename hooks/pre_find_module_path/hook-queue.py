warning for 'import queue' in 2.7 from the future

Problem appears to be that pyinstaller cannot have two modules of the same
name that differ only by lower/upper case.  The from the future 'queue' simply
imports all of the 'Queue' module.  So by my reading, since 'queue' and 'Queue'
can not coexist in a frozen app, and since 'queue' requires 'Queue', there is
no way to use 'queue' in a frozen 2.7 app.
